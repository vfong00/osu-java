# osu! in processing - Final Project for MKS22X

## What is this thing?
This is an attempt to recreate osu! (and similar derivatives of the game) <br/>
Here's the wiki page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu! <br/>
TL;DR Clicker game. <br/>
This game currently features:
- A clickable circle that disappears upon being clicked OR the approach circle is on the circle.
- Streak counting
- Cool textures!

## But like, how do you even start the game?
You'll need Processing!
